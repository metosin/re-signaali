## 1.4.2 (2023-12-09)

#### Fixed

  - `re-frame.utils` failed to load in a clj runtime, due to interop issues.

## 1.4.1 (2023-12-07)

#### Added

  - `dispatch-sync` now emits a `:sync` trace to indicate when it has finished. See [re-frame-10x#165](https://github.com/day8/re-frame-10x/issues/165)

## 1.4.0 (2023-11-02)

#### Breaking
  - `re-frame.std-interceptors/path` now keeps a `:re-frame.db/path-history` key in the context, not a `:re-frame-path/db-store` key. This shouldn't affect users, unless you're directly hacking the event loop.
  - [763](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/763) on detecting an incorrect event structure, the `unwrap` interceptor now exceptions instead of writing an error to `js/console` and continuing.

#### Added
  - Interceptors now have an optional `:comment` key. It's a no-op.
  - `re-frame.std-interceptors/path` now remembers the path it uses in a `:comment`. ([re-frame-10x#165](https://github.com/day8/re-frame-10x/issues/165))
  - `re-frame.alpha` namespace, for testing proposed features (see [flows](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/discussions/795) and [polymorphic subscriptions](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/issues/680#issuecomment-1676487563))

#### Changed

  - Upgrade reagent to 1.2.0
  - Added `reg-event-error-handler` to provide a way to handle errors in the interceptor chain [#423](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/pull/423).
